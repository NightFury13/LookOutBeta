===========

Is an android application built for the hearing impaired and people who love to stay on their headphones 24*7.
It keeps a real-time check on your ambient noise levels, figures out what the current average noise is and if it finds anything
anamolous to that, (say a car honk, or a doorbell) it vibrates and provides notification sounds if the headphones are plugged in.

Now with additional features of detecting speech and non-speech input signals in case of emergencies.
